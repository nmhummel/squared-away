**Description:**
Like a good dork, I love Doctor Who. I decided to make a game where the Dalek (player) has to defeat (collect) all of the TARDIS on the grid. Simple game, but a fun piece.

**How to Get In on the Fun:**
* This project's backend/API was made with Ruby version: ruby 2.6.1p33 (2019-01-30 revision 66950) [x86_64-linux] 
* Frontend courtesy of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
* Fork a copy and download the files from https://github.com/nmhummel/squared-away
* Make sure you bundle install after cloning it.
* Run $rails db:seed AND $rails db:migrate to fill the database and load your boards.
* System dependencies include a console of some sort: Windows Power Shell, Command Prompt, Ubuntu, etc.
* Start your rails server by going into the backend folder: 
    $cd backend
    $rails s 
...and launch your localhost:3000 or whatever http:// is provided.
